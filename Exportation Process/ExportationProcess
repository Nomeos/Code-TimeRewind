# Exportation process

## Software

1. Download [JarSplice](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjarsplice040jar.htm)

## Process of Exportation

1. In Eclipse, go to File > Export... > Java > JAR file.
  1. Select CodeTimeRewind as the resource to export.
  1. Uncheck files at right (.classpath, .project, derby.log, etc...).
  1. Uncheck file CodeTimeRewind/src/model.databaseManager/DatabaseAccountManagerTest.java.
  1. Only Check "Export all output folders for checked projects".
  1. Select the export destination.
  1. Check "Compress the contents of the JAR file" and "Overwrite existing files without warning".
  1. Click on "next" 2 times and add the Main class at the bottom.
  1. In the Main class area, put "main.Main".
  1. Only after all of that you can click on "Finish".

1. Open JarSplice

  1. In "ADD JARS", add :
      * the previous exported jar
      * all the jars in the libs folder of the project.

  1. In "ADD NATIVES", add :
      * all the .dll in the native folder of the project.

  1. In "MAIN CLASS", put main.Main in the field.

  1. After that, you can directly create a Jar in the "CREATE FAT JAR" section.
  1. But if we launch the game, it's still not working, that's why we need to take the "res" folder from the project. And copy it directly next to the Jar that we just created. At the end, we will only keep the "FAT JAR" that we created at last and the "res" folder.
